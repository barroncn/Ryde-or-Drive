# Ryde or Drive App

[Check it out here!](https://barroncn.github.io/Ryde-or-Drive/)

Ryde or Drive compares the cost of taking a ride share like Uber or Lyft to the cost of driving oneself. It also takes displays current wait times for rideshare drivers and current drive time to your location. Currently the app relies on a Firebase database to store average MPGs for different car types made in different years. The price of gas is also hard coded. For future development, we would pay for an API similar to Kelly Blue Book (that was not available for free) to get more exact fuel consumption figures. Additionally, we would like to be able to pull gas prices from a users vicinity to increase the accuracy of the drive cost. Currently the site links to a parking website, but this would be an excellent addition to the users driving cost consideration. 

This app was created by a group of four developers. I was in charge of the Uber, Lyft, and Google Directions API's--both making the request and parsing the JSON data. I also helped in creating the UI concept and created a rough outline of the websites design.
